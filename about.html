						</header>
						<p>The Open Exchange for Social Change is the official IODC unconference. The unconference will be an open and safe space for you to  exchange thoughts,ideas and knowledge with your peers .  Our primary focus of the event will be on how open data creates, contributes and supports  social change. We want to better understand the actions we need to take to increase positive impact in our communities. Your ideas and actions will be feed into the main conference, and help us to set the goals for the IODC roadmap.</p>

							<a name="whatisuncon"><h2 class=titles>What is an Unconference?</h2></a>
						</header>
						<p>An Unconference is a type of event or conference in which the agenda is created by the participants at the beginning of the day. This event philosophy and facilitation style is designed to maximise collaboration and peer to peer sharing. All participants are invited to propose and facilitate sessions and we encourage participants to attend and move between sessions as they see fit. In contrast to a more traditional event in which the agenda is set in advance by the organisers or a programme committee and sessions have a tendency to be highly structured, unconference sessions are participant driven, drawing on the expertise, skill sets and interests of the people in the room. The unconference structure aims to encourage dialog, creativity, idea exchange, and building a sense of solidarity and common purpose between participants.</p>

						<p>See <a href="#buddies">Become a Buddy</a> below for more information on proposing a session and also the other ways that you can contribute to The Open Exchange.</p>

						</header>
						<p>Anyone attending the IODC conference is welcome to join The Open Exchange. We encourage representatives from civil society, the media, the private sector and government to come along! Whether you’re a newbie to the open data world or seasoned veteran, your contribution to the discussion is essential. While we will be taking notes during the day, remote participation in real time will not be possible and therefore you’ll need to be in Madrid on October 4th in order to participate. </p>
